# Business Intelligence for Modern Data Teams

Build a polished business intelligence system using only SQL and markdown. 

Evidence offers a modern development workflow for analysts and a polished user experience for decision-makers.

# How It Works
Evidence creates pages from markdown files. When you write SQL statements inside those files, Evidence runs it against your data warehouse.

You can reference the results of those queries directly in your markdown document's text, or you can use them to make charts, graphs, and tables using our built-in component library.

Evidence compiles your markdown documents into a fast and reliable website. It tests your queries and keeps the site up-to-date with your data warehouse.

Evidence supports loops, conditionals, parameterized pages, tests and more. It's easy to get started and you can build data products which are both more sophisticated and dramatically easier to use than what you can build with a typical BI tool.
