Casey note: I like how the Rails tutorial calls out what you'll achieve, and adds these satisfying green checkmarks. I think it makes the reader feel good and excited. Baked my own CSS for this, happy to change to your suggestions

## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you have already installed Evidence: [Install Evidence](/docs/install-evidence).

New to web development? Start with the [Basics](#basics).

Familiar with running a server at `localhost`, and writing pages in Markdown? Skip to [Working with data](#working-with-data).

# Basics
## 1. Start the dev server at localhost:3000

Start your development server, if isn't already running: 

- VSCode: Click `Start Evidence` in the bottom status bar.
- Command Line: Run `npm run dev` in your project directory.

If you chose a different setup during [Install Evidence](/docs/install-evidence), use the command that matches your setup.

Your browser should open automatically. If it doesn't, open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` in the address bar. You should see your Evidence project:

<img src="/img/getting-started/evidence_landing.png" width="400" class="tut-img"/>



<div id="objectives" class="alert svelte-17118v7">
<strong>What's a dev server?</strong>
<br/>
Dev server? localhost:3000? Hot reload? If you're new to web development, these terms might be unfamiliar. Don't worry.
<br/><br/>
It's not required for this tutorial, but if you want to find out more about what's going on under the hood, take a look at this FAQ about local development. [TODO add link]
</div>

## 2. Add a new page

Go back to VSCode (or your file editor of choice) and open the `src/pages` directory. Right-click on the `pages` directory and select `New File`. Name the file `new-page.md`, or a name of your choice.

Add the following to the file and save it (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`):

```markdown
## Hello Evidence

This is a new page in Evidence.
```

Head back to Evidence in your browser. You should see your new page in the sidebar. If not, refresh:

<img src="/img/getting-started/new_page.png" width="400" class="tut-img"/>

## 3. Make more changes
Make some more changes to the page. You'll see them reflected "live" in the browser, immediately after saving. There is no need to restart the server. 

This is called **hot reloading**, and it allows you to see your changes in real-time.

Evidence pages are `.md` files, and are written in a popular language called Markdown. You can learn more about Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

You can also insert HTML directly into your page if you need more control.

Here are some examples of Markdown and HTML to try:

```markdown
## Hello Evidence

This is a new page in Evidence.

### This is a lower level header
This is some *italic* and **bold** text.

This is a [link](https://evidence.dev).

This is an image inserted using Markdown: 
![alt text](https://evidence.dev/brand-assets/wordmark-black.png)

This is an image inserted using HTML:
<img src="https://evidence.dev/brand-assets/wordmark-black.png" alt="evidence logo" width="200"/>

```

And here's how it will look when rendered in the browser:

<img src="/img/getting-started/markdown_html.png" width="400" class="tut-img"/>

Now that you know how to create and edit pages, let's move on to working with data.

# Working with data
## 4. Set up a source query

Navigate to `localhost:3000/settings` in your browser.

Here you'll find our demo dataset, `needful_things`. It is a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) database, which is one of many databases that Evidence supports.

<img src="/img/getting-started/duck_db.png" width="90%" class="tut-img"/>

Later in this tutorial you will learn how to load a new data source. For now, we will use `needful_things` to write a source query.

A data source in Evidence consists of 3 parts:

1. The **data source** itself. In our example, all of our data sits within a file called `needful_things.duckdb`.
2. A **source query** allows you to filter and transform your data source before you start using it on a page. `needful_things` can contain many columns, but you may only need a few of them. Your source query should be written in the dialect of SQL that matches your data source.
3. A **connection.yaml** file. Any configuration or credentials needs to connect to your data source should be defined here. This file is automatically generated when you create a new data source via the `/settings` page.

You will see this reflected in the folder structure for each data source under the `sources` folder:
<img src="/img/getting-started/sources.png" width="70%" class="tut-img"/>

Add a new `.sql` file to the `sources/needful_things` directory. Name it `my_query.sql`, or a name of your choice.

In this file, write a query to select all columns from the `needful_things` table:

**my_query.sql**
```sql
## change this
SELECT * FROM orders
```

Save the file. Later, you'll be able to refer to this data source as `needful_things.my_query`.

## 6. Create a chart

Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum 

## 7. Connect a new CSV data source

## Help and support
If you run into any issues, [reach out in Slack.](https://slack.evidence.dev)

<Alert status="info">
TODO / thought: Not sure how much Slack retention history you guys have, but it might be nice to have a dedicated channel for tutorial support, so users can search for their issue in case someone else has already encountered it. Or post new ones (i.e. if this tut goes out of date)
