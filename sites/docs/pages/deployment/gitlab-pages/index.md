[GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) is a service that allows you to host static websites and single-page apps. Evidence apps can be deployed to GitLab Pages by pushing your Evidence project to a GitLab repository and enabling Pages for the repository.

## Prerequisites

- A [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) account
- An Evidence project pushed to a GitLab repository

## Deploy your app

1. In <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank" class="markdown">GitLab</a>, navigate to your Evidence project repository.
1. Select **Deploy > Pages** in the left sidebar.
1. Get started with GitLab Pages
    - Build image: `node:22`
    - The application files are in the `public` folder: `true` (we'll change this in Evidence later)
    - Installation steps: `npm ci`
    - Build steps: 
        - `npm run sources`
        - `npm run build`
        - `cp -r build public`
    - Add a commit message, and click **Commit**

Your app will be available at `https://[your-repo]-[hexcode].gitlab.io/`.
