<Details title="Which git providers can I use with Evidence Cloud?">

We support GitHub by default. If your team needs another git provider, reach out on [Slack](https://slack.evidence.dev).

</Details>

### Troubleshooting

<Details title="I've successfully deployed the template project. How do I edit it?">

Clone the git repository to your local machine (the repo URL is shown in the cloud UI), make edits to the code and/or database settings, and merge the edits to your target branch.

</Details>


<Details title="How long do builds take?">

Most builds will be completed in under 2 minutes, and you can track progress in the build logs. The initial deployment may take longer as we provision your account.

</Details>


<Details title="When can I expect build failures?">

Evidence will not deploy sites with errors to prevent users from seeing broken reports. Usually, this is caused by an error with your project code.  Enter `npm run build` in your editor to test if the build succeeds locally. If you are still having issues, reach out on [Slack](https://slack.evidence.dev).

</Details>

<Details title="How can I prevent queries or components with errors from making it to my site?">

As a default, a failed chart or query will not throw an error. To prevent failed charts or queries from building successfully, edit the build command in `package.json` to `"build": "evidence build:strict"`.
