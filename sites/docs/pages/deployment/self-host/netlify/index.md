**Netlify URL Lowercasing**

All URLs on Netlify are converted to lowercase. This can cause issues if you're using `{params.my_param}` to filter data in your markdown. It's recommended to use lowercase any time you're using a URL parameter to filter data, like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM source_name.my_table 
WHERE LOWER(my_column) = LOWER('${params.my_param}')
```

</Alert>

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is a cloud platform for building and deploying web apps and frontend sites. It can be used to deploy Evidence apps by linking your Evidence project.

Netlify lets you host a public version of your app for free, or you can create and host a password-protected version with Netlify's $15/month plan.

## Prerequisites

- An Evidence project pushed to a Git service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- A Netlify account.

## Deploy your app

1. From the Netlify dashboard, select **Add new site >> Import an existing project**
1. Choose your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps)
1. Select the repository containing your Evidence project
1. In the build settings
  - **Build command**: `npm run sources && npm run build`
  - **Publish directory**: `build`
1. In the environment variables
  - Click **New variable**
  - With your Evidence dev server running, go to the [settings page](http://localhost:3000/settings#deploy) and copy each of the environment variables
  - Paste them into the Netlify environment variables section
1. (If using a monorepo) edit the base directory to point to your Evidence project
1. Click **Deploy [your-site-name]**

Your app will be available at `https://[your-site-name].netlify.app`.

## Domains, Authentication and Scheduling

{@partial "evidence-cloud.md"}

### Authentication

#### Global password

Setting a global password requires a Netlify paid plan ($15/month).

Follow the directions provided by Netlify to set up a password for your site:

Netlify Dashboard >> [your-site] >> Site configuration >> Access & security >> Visitor access >> Configure site protection >> Basic password protection

#### OAuth

Netlify only supports OAuth via GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

Netlify Dashboard >> [your-site] >> Site configuration >> Access & security >> OAuth

### Custom domains

Your app will be deployed to https://[your-site-name].netlify.app

You can set a custom domain using Netlify from the console:

Netlify Dashboard >> [your-site] >> Domain management >> Add a domain

### Data refresh

#### Schedule updates using Build Hooks

If you want your site to update on a regular schedule, you can use GitHub Actions (or another similar service) to schedule regular calls to a [Netlify build hook](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-hooks/).

1. Create a [Netlify build hook](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-hooks/) in **Site configuration > Build & deploy > Continuous deployment > Build hooks**
   ![netlify-add-build-hook](/img/netlify-add-build-hook.png)
   This will give you a URL that GitHub will use to trigger builds
2. Add `NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK` to your Github Repo's Secrets
   - In your GitHub repo, go to Settings > Secrets > Actions and click **New repository secret**<br/><br/>
     ![netlify-github-new-secret](/img/netlify-github-new-secret.png)
   - Add the build hook URL as the secret value
     ![netlify-github-secret](/img/netlify-github-secret.png)
3. Add a schedule file to your project
   - Create a new directory in your project called `.github`
   - Within that directory, create another called `workflows`
   - Add a new file in `.github/workflows` called `main.yml`
4. Add the following text to the `main.yml` file you just created. Be sure that the spacing and indentation is exactly as presented here, as it will impact whether the action runs correctly
    ```yaml
    name: Schedule Netlify Build
    on:
      workflow_dispatch:
      schedule:
        - cron: '0 10 * * *' # Once a day around 6am ET (10am UTC)
    jobs:
      build:
        name: Request Netlify Webhook
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: POST to Build Hook
            env:
              BUILD_HOOK: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK }}
            run: curl -X POST -d {} $BUILD_HOOK
    ```
5. See your GitHub Actions run in the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repo
