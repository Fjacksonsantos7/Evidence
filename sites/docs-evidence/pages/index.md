# What is Evidence?

  Evidence allows you to build a polished business intelligence system using only SQL & Markdown.

You can create automated reports, analysis and tools that feel like they came from the graphics department at a top-tier publication. 

## How does it work? 

Evidence creates pages from markdown files. When you write SQL statements inside those files, Evidence runs it against your data warehouse.

![How Evidence Works](how-it-works.png)

Evidence has a rich library of [chart and components](/features/charts/examples).

Evidence supports [loops](/features/advanced/templating#loops), [conditional logic](http://localhost:4567/features/advanced/templating#conditionals), [parameterized pages](/features/advanced/parameterized-pages), tests and more.

## Who is it for? 
You don't need to be a web developer to use Evidence. The only skills you need to get started are the ability to write SQL and markdown.

If you're ready to get started, [install Evidence &#8594](/getting-started/install-evidence)
