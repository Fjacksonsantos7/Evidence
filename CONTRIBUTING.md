## Community Rules

1. Be respectful
2. Help each other
3. Document solutions to problems for the benefit of the community

## Create an Issue

Issues can include bugs, feature ideas, docs improvements, database connector requests, and any other suggestions or ideas you have for improving Evidence.

[Create an issue here](https://github.com/evidence-dev/evidence/issues/new/choose)

### How to write a good issue

1. Look before you post - read the docs, check if an issue already exists
2. If an issue already exists, upvote and comment on it! Let us know multiple people have the issue by adding a thumbs up to that issue
3. Use the right issue template - bug report, docs request, feature request, database connector request
4. Give your issue a clear and descriptive title
5. Help us help you - fill out the issue template, give clear system info, error messages, and steps to reproduce

### Resolving issues

If you create a new issue, someone from the Evidence team will respond within 24 hours.

If you have a solution for an issue someone else posted, please comment on that issue with the solution.

### Private information

If your problem relates to sensitive or private information, please don't post any of your data in an issue. We suggest creating a small test dataset that can reproduce the problem without revealing any private info, and posting that data in the issue. If that's not possible, please reach out to support@evidence.dev.

## Contribute Code

### Testing Changes

You can test your changes by running `npm run dev` form within the `./sites/example-project` project.
Note that changes to the `components` package should be done within `./sites/example-project/src/component`.  During the build, `./sites/example-project/src/component` will be copied over to `./packages/components`).  All other packages can be updated directly in `./packages/components`.

### Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcome! We review pull requests as they are submitted and will reach out to you with any questions or comments.

If you haven't submitted a pull request before, see the [GitHub Pull Request Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
